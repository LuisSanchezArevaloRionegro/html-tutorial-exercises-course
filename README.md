Hello, my name is Alejandro S√°nchez [@alesanchezr](https://twitter.com/alesanchezr), follow me on twitter for free coding courses and tutorials like this.

I have prepared this exercises for anyone interested in learning HTML from scratch, we will go over the following concepts:

1. Get familiar with most of the most popular HTML Tags.
2. Using the tags together to create a simple HTML Website.
3. Linking websites together using Anchors with Realive or Abolute paths.
4. The HTML audio and video tag.

### ‚û°Ô∏è incremental & ‚úîÔ∏è Autograded

I've built the exercises incrementally, you should feel the progress little by little, and hopefully, the difficulty raising between exercises will never be too big to get you frustrated.
All have been automatically graded thanks to @haydavid23

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **index.js:** represents the entry file for the entire app.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.
